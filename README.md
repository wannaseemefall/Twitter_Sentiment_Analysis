# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
A sentiment analysis project that classifies tweets as positive or negative using machine learning and NLP techniques.
Due to GitHub's file size limit, the dataset is not included in this repository.

Run the Jupyter Notebook (`model.ipynb`) to preprocess the data and train the model.
